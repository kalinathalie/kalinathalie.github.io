FireShell Security Team is a project that emerged in February 2017 with the goal of being a team of research and dissemination of knowledge in InfoSec. We participate in Capture The Flag events, both national and international, we use these types of events to improve our skills in the most diverse areas related to information security. We investigate vulnerabilities in equipment, tools and operating systems in search of failures, helping developers and manufacturers to further improve their products.
