Hi everyone! C:

This DamCTF was pretty awesome, we played with a half of the team and two guests and got #8/827 place.

On this CTF I focused on MISC challs and solved 4. Here I'll explain a sequence of 3 challs, and the other chall will be posted soon.

**All the challs bellow was made by perchik (perchik#7272)**

#### Solution

This UsrClass.dat is a MS Windows registry file contains information regarding applications which have been executed. We can map all the files with the software [ShellBags Explorer](https://www.sans.org/tools/shellbags-explorer/).

Like that:

There is here some suspicious directory names, so if the path names is the only thing that we have, let's search this on Google...

Yeah, we got that!
So, after some checks on the Github Repositories, we found this Discord Bot Token on commits:

![](https://i.imgur.com/YPPBYaT.png)

At first moment, We can up this bot to read all messages, members and channels of all servers that this bot is related.

```py
import discord, base64
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='$', case_insensitive=True)

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print('We have logged in as {0.user}'.format(bot))
    for guild in bot.guilds:
        print("Servers:")
        print(guild.name)
        for member in guild.members:
            print("Members:")
            print(member)
        for channel in guild.text_channels:
            print("Channels:")
            print(channel.name)
            for current_message in await channel.history(limit=500).flatten():
                print(current_message.author)
                print(current_message.content)

token = base64.b64decode(b'T0RReU1qUTNPRFl6TWpVek56STVNamt3LllKeWljZy43S0c5MzRWRWxtM1J0Wm45YlVhQ0xTdnJPeUk=').decode()
bot.run(token)
```

This worked!, a lot of messages like this SUP3R H4CK3R W3BCH4T above, bot nothing of flag :(

So... let's create a invite for this Discord server...

```py
import discord, base64
from discord.ext import commands
.
.
.
        for channel in guild.text_channels:
            link = await channel.create_invite(max_age = 300)
            print(link)
.
.
.
```

BOOM! Tha flag did'nt appear before because this text was embbeded, and the bot was only showing normal messages.

`dam{Ep1c_Inf1ltr4t0r_H4ck1ng!!!!!!1!}`

### Imp3rs0nAt0r-2

#### Description

57 solves / 471 points

>Great work figuring out their next moves! We have gone ahead and preemptively secured the aforementioned services. Now letâ€™s start to try and put this whole thing to rest.

>Can you find the full name of the person who was behind the operation?

>Submit the flag as dam{firstname_lastname}.


#### Solution

Ok, let's see the `nc-lnvp` profile on Discord:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5ly13iS.png)

Of course that this is a hint, let's search about the E-mail on Github commits.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qE3JqaB.png)

Easy, `nn9262186@gmail.com`.

After some HOURS OSINTing this E-mail on Google, Github, DuckDuckGo and whatever E-mail/Gmail recon tool, we found this website: [tools.epieos](https://tools.epieos.com/email.php).
Basically this site is a compilation of Google Account recon tool, [Holehe](https://github.com/megadose/holehe), and LinkedIn linked E-mails.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kCSkkOV.png)

This is one of lot of solves about OSINT/Recon on Google E-mails. Google Accounts have some public information like GoogleID, E-mail, Contributions on Google Maps, Photos and Calendar, on this chall there is another way via Maps, as we can see on this comment:

![](https://i.imgur.com/dZ5SM0Z.png)

So...

Flag: `dam{pax_vallejo}`

### Imp3rs0nAt0r-3

#### Description

37 solves / 482 points

>Amazing work figuring out who this "hacker" really is! Unfortunately, we have no leads as to what their current whereabouts could possibly be.

>Can you try and deduce the address of where they are staying? Maybe you can find some vacation photos to help you out.

>Submit the flag as dam{full_name_of_hotel_as_it_appears_on_google}.


#### Solution

`Pax Vallejo` is on Hotel? ok!

This last chall made me crazy... Why? The only thing location-related that we found about `Pax Vallejo` was the comment on `Oregon State University`, so after lot of hours searching about Hotels on Oregon State, Corvallis city and brute-forcing hundred of Hotels on this location on format flag, we concluded: this F****** script kiddie isn't there!
Ok, let's back to OSINT thing...

I have to say that after search on each social media, `Twitter`, unfortunatelly, was the last thing that appear on my head, why? My brain: "This is the last chall, `Twitter` is too obvious". Hahahahaha

![](https://i.imgur.com/kbZNhe8.png)

Yeah, finally!

There is 5 pictures on this account(a museum, a river, a trains station, and 2 images about the current location showing trains and rails), for not image-spamming I'll just post the link here and you can check: https://twitter.com/cheesep27684825 .

After checking that there is no trains around Oregon State University hahahaha... my girlfriend found that the images was taken in London because this tower below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/UfWx8kL.png)


Now starts the real FBI job... (This isn't funny cuz I never ever got on a train)

![](https://i.imgur.com/5heRCfg.png)

On first image we can see `Circle line` on train, I researched about the London train map for this line... nothing else lot of results and hours.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vVyhHg7.png)

Lot of numbers em data that I don't even know how to look.

OK, after some hours, on the first image that show the `Pax Vallejo` Point of view, we can see this tower followed by a building-with-circular-thing on top.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bGZuidn.png)


Definitively, a church. So, let's search some high chuchrs in London...

![](https://i.imgur.com/vpS3J3W.jpg)

No joke, searching `London Church` on Google Images we can see this image above. Seems similar.

This church is called `St Mary Abbots Parish`. So with We want to see that better, let's use [Google Earth](https://www.google.com.br/intl/pt-BR/earth/) to check this church followed by a building-with-circular-thing.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gNxadMA.jpg)

Yeah, finally we got that! (Google Earth is insane).

Following the image to the `Pax Vallejo` building...

![](https://i.imgur.com/1t92Fbh.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/cN95g6u.jpg)

The name is `Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington`.
So the flag is: `dam{copthorne_tara_hotel_london_kensington}`
