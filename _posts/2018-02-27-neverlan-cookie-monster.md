1.A little recon in case you don't know who is "cookie monster"
+ Google search "cookie monster"
+ It's a character from Sesame Street

2.The description's URL gives you only this string
> He's my favorite Red guy
+ Google search "cookie monster best friend red"
+ It's a character named Elmo

3.Open the browser's web developer tools and check the request headers, in the "network" tab

4.Notice the cookie
> Red_Guy's_name=NameGoesHere

5.Send the request with his name
```
$ curl -v --cookie "Red_Guy's_name=Elmo" http://neverlanctf-challenges-elb-2146429546.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:14098/
